                <p class="sample-p">Kiran startled awake, cold wet having seeped through his clothes.  He willed his eyes to focus and eventually they relented, but the steel skys offered neither comfort nor context.  As his senses returned, Kiran felt he was not alone.</p>
                <p class="sample-p">He struggled to find footing in the ice-slick mud, but it was a sobering realization that forced him to his knees.  From his new vantage, Kiran saw the faces of the dead that surrounded him.  Faces twisted in horror and confusion and shock.  Faces covered in mud and blood and misery.  Faces, familiar in life, now alien in death.</p>
                <p class="sample-p">How long had Kiran slept?  The sickly smell of blood and filth hung heavy in the air, but the wind did not yet carry the calls of carrion birds.</p>
                <p class="sample-p">A cough and a gasp broke the wretched stillness and shook his thoughts from him.  He reached for his father's blade, but the scabbard was empty.  Kiran's blood froze and his eyes went wild like those of the horse that had thrown him.  He fumbled in the mud with numb, shaking fingers.</p>
                <p class="sample-p">At last, his hand wrapped around the hilt of a sword and he swung it in a wild arc as he spun to meet his foe.  His gaze fell on a figure sat hunched in the mud.  The figure wore the enemy's colors, but he couldn't have been fifteen years old.  Not much older than his own brother.</p>
                <p class="sample-p">Kiran stepped forward and the boy moved to push himself back, but his feet found no purchase.</p>
                <p class="sample-p">"No. Please."  The boy threw up his hands, spittle flying from his mouth as he sobbed.  "Please.  God, no."</p>
                <p class="sample-p">Kiran's footsteps faltered as his vision blurred with tears.  He no longer marched as a soldier to dispatch an enemy. He trudged, dragging his feet.  A child sent to murder a child.</p>
